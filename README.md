# Java Programming With Telusko

1.Setup the Environment
2.started with variables and its behaviour

# Variables and Data Types

1.The thing that suprised me is the string that can be treated as an integer

# Switch Case

1.Completed the switch case with the respected example

# Methods And Objects

1.Completed the basic foundation for the methods and objects in java 
*class Calculator{

   public int sub(int num1,int num2){
    int result = num1-num2;
    return result;
  }
}
that the public keyword in the method is optional 

# Some keyword meaning

 public static void main(String a[])

 void keyword:

   it is used when the coder is doesn't expect any return value from the method


# Method Overloading

   class Calculator{

   public int add(int num1,int num2){
        int cal = num1+num2;
        return cal;
   }                                      //this is called method overloading that we can have the same method name but with different arguments and parameters we can do it this is called method overloading

   public int add(int num1,int num2,int num3){
       int res = num1+num2+num3;
       return res;
   }
   }

# Stack and heap memory

*please learn stack and heap memory in java clearly in any other channel
